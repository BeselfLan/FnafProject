# Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) 6 recreation

Creative project for Grade 10 computer science. Made by Beself Lan because I enjoy horror games and
uses Java Swing.

Goal of the game is to survive 5 nights in a row, with each night including more animatorics (enemies).
Animatronics will randomly roam the ventilation system, a map included in the movement/audio computer tabs.
They are attrachted to sound, specifically your fan and computer (which can be toggled on and off). Once in the
adjacent vent to your office, a movement noise will indicate their approach, Scare then away by turning to the vent 
you hear them from until they go away.

The movement tab will scan every few seconds and indicate where animatrocis are in the ventilation system.
The audio tab plays a noise in the indicated room increasing the probability that animatronics move to that room.

Finish the night by compelting the tasks on the computer, keeping any animatroics from entering your office, and
logging off the computer.
